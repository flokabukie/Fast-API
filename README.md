Welcome to the Machine Learning API project! This repository showcases the development of a powerful and scalable machine learning API using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for leveraging machine learning models. By creating a robust API, we enable seamless integration of our models into various applications, making it easy for developers to consume the power of machine learning.
